// <Array copy>
/*
- A new array assigned to an old array will incur problems when the new array is changed as the old array will change with it.
- To resolve this the copy should be used.

//1. Shallow copy (can usually be used but not for nested arrays)

int[] array1 = {1, 2, 3};
int[] array2;
array2 = array1.clone();

//2. Deep copy (use this for nested arrays)
